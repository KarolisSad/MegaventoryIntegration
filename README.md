## Megaventory Integration
 
The system is an integral part of the WebShop shopping cart, which utilizes the Megaventory database to manage products, clients, suppliers, and their relationships. By integrating an inventory management system, the process of controlling inventory products becomes significantly easier, thanks to automatic reordering and other useful features accessible through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).
